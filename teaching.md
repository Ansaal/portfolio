# Teaching & Workshops

*These workshops were conducted alongside software developer roles at each company, demonstrating my commitment to knowledge sharing and team growth.*

## Teaching Approach
- **Student-Centered:** I tailor content to diverse learning styles and experience levels to ensure each participant thrives.
- **Hands-On & Interactive:** Sessions emphasize live coding, practical labs, and real-world project development.
- **Collaborative Learning:** I foster peer programming, group discussions, and continuous feedback for deeper understanding.
- **Adaptive Curriculum:** I adjust pace, depth, and examples based on learner needs and project goals.
